<h1>The best movies according to Rodrigo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>My favourite movie ever. I'm in love with mafia movies and I think this is the best one in this genre. Al Paccino's performance together with the story, the soundtrack and film's aesthetics make of this my favourite film. </p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>In my oppinion, one of the most beautiful films. The film mix happiness and sadness and show how hard life in prison can be.</p>
<h3>Catch me if you can</h3>
<p>One of the best DiCaprio perfomances. The funny way such an important story based on real life events is told seems perfect to me.  </p>
